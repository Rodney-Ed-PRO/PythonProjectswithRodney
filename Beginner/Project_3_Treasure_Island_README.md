👋 This is my third Python Project called Treasure Island! This is an interactive story where the program asks the use to enter their choice to progress through the storyline!

🐍 Here are the lessons I applied within this lesson and project:
* Control flow with if/else statements:
    if condition:
        do this
    else:
        do this
* Comparison operators:
    * > greater than
    * < less than
    * >= greater than or equal to
    * <= less than or equal to 
    * == equals to 
    * != not equal to 
    * % remainder
* Nested if and elif statements
* Multiple if statements to check multiple conditions in succession versus an if/elif/else statement that will execute one condition
* Logical operators:
    * AND
    * OR
    * NOT
* More useful functions:
    * .lower() -> coverts all characters in string input to lower case
    * .count("a") - > counts the number of times a certain character occurs in a string; in this case, it will count the number of times the letter a occurs. 
* Helpful Resources:
    * flow chart to visually describe the control flow of the program. Helpful site is draw.io
    * ASCII art website to incorporate visuals into code 


📂 Additional Comments:
* use a backward slash '\' in front of an apostrophe in a word that contains an apostrophe so that Python ignores it and doesn't consider it to be the beginning or end of another string

👋 This is my second Python Project called Tip Calculator! The Tip Calculator will provide the user with the total bill per person after tips are included.

🐍 Here are the lessons I applied within project:
* Data Types:
    * strings
    * integers
    * floats
    * booleans
* Debugging:
    * type error
* Type Checking, Type Conversion (aka Type Casting)
    * type() function to check the kind of data I'm working with
    * Type conversion functions:
        * str()
        * int()
        * float()
* Mathematical Operators:
    * +
    * -
    * / -> division operation with single forward slash produces a float quotient
    * // -> division operation with double forward slash produced an integer quotient
    * '**' exponent
* Number Manipulation:
    * round() function to round final values and you can specify the number of decimal places you wish to round the final value
    * {:.2f} to format final output to display final value, in this case, my final dollar value with 2 decimal places
* f String
    * a really useful way to combine strings and other data types into one print message without having to manually convert each data type

📂 Additional Comments:
* we can use underscore in place of commas when typing out large numbers to support readability; for example, 1,234,567 on paper can typed in Python as 1_234_567 instead of 1234567
* Mathematical expressions in Python always gets evaluated using BEDMAS which I learned is also called PEMDAS

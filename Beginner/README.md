👋 This is my first Python Project called Band Name Generator! The Band Name Generator will provide the user with a band name by asking the user to enter the city they grew up in and the name of their pet.

🐍 Here's what I learned with this project:
* print function
* input function
* commenting using hashtag or ctrl + / shortcut 
* debugging 
    * syntax error
    * indentation error
    * name error
* string manipulation (i.e. concatentation)
* variables (naming conventions)

📂 Additional Comments:
* this project can be complete with and without the use of variables
